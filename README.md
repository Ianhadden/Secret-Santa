# Secret Santa

A program to administrate a game of secret santa.
Takes in a tsv file of the format:

<pre> Person's Name    Their email address    Things they like </pre>

And randomly assigns each participant another to give
a gift to. Outputs a cheat-sheet file for whoever is
running to game, and a message to be sent to each player
giving them information about who they are giving to,
when the event is going to be held, etc.
